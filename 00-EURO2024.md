# The FANZinE project and EURO 2024 Fan Zones
The FANZinE project finds a unique and timely extension in the context of EURO 2024. As one of the continent's most significant sporting events, EURO 2024 provides an opportunity to examine the social dynamics and identity formation that occur within fan zones. The tournament's fan zones, dedicated areas in all host cities where fans can gather to watch live broadcasts and engage in a variety of activities, are perfect sites for our research. They constitute areas where fans from across Europe interact and experience the tournament together.

# Aims and scope of the Fan Zone project
The project **„Connecting Europe through Football: Identity, Belonging, and Cohesion at EURO 2024”**, funded by the FORETHEM University Alliance, aims to investigate how the experiences within these communal spaces during EURO 2024 impact the sense of European identity among fans. Specifically, it seeks to understand how shared experiences in fan zones can foster connections and common ground among diverse European citizens. By focusing on the interactions and social dynamics within fan zones, the project aims to highlight the role of football in creating a more united and cohesive Europe.

# Methodology
To achieve these aims, the project will deploy a survey to visitors in the fan zones across various host cities to gather quantitative data on demographics, experiences, and perceptions of European identity and social cohesion. The insights gained from this project will contribute significantly to the academic discourse on the social and cultural impacts of football events. Moreover, the findings will provide valuable recommendations for event organizers and policymakers on how to design and implement fan zones that promote social cohesion and European unity. Ultimately, the project seeks to demonstrate how the sport can play a crucial role in fostering a more united and cohesive Europe "from below."
