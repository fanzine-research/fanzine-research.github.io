## Football, European identities and social cohesion in Europe

The FANZinE project is explores the potential of professional men's club football for shaping and fostering shared identity and social cohesion in Europe. Football as one of the most popular and unifying cultural phenomena on the continent transcends geographical, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. Its universal appeal makes it a potent tool for fostering connections and common ground among diverse European citizens. As a highly Europeanized sport with regular matches between teams from all over Europe, freedom of movement for players and personnel, intense media coverage, and dense cross-border networks of fans, football not only creates shared experiences, but also reflects the interconnectedness of Europe itself. Fans experience Europe, form connections to other Europeans, and explore a Europeanised life-world through their lived fandom. By analysing football and football fandom in Europe, this project seeks to highlight the intricate ways in which following football and and participating in football-related activities can contribute to the formation of European identities and the strengthening of social bonds. It aims to provide valuable insights into how a seemingly simple sport can play a pivotal role in fostering a more united and cohesive Europe “from below”.

## Methodology

We approach our research object by using a mixed-method research strategy consisting of three methodological steps:
- a **quantitative text analysis** of the media representation of European competitions in football related online media to assess media representations of national and European competitions in specialist media
- an **online panel survey of fans and non-fans** on Europe to measure the dimensions of communities of belonging and frames of reference as well as compare identity formations between countries and with non-fans
- **expert interviews with actors from clubs, associations and fan organisations** actively involved in fan work to identify current practice and future opportunities for actively promoting European awareness and cohesion

With this approach we combine quantitative with qualitative steps and seek to comprehensively investigate the processes of identity formation and its role for social cohesion across Europe.

## Case selection 
<img src="/images/FANZinE_Länder.png" align="right" width="200px"/> The research project examines four countries in Europe: Germany, Norway, Poland and Spain. This case selection ensures that the units of analysis vary along a set of potentially influential variables such as their national league's competitive context, their geographical location, cultural and historical factors and their connection to the EU. The case selection reflects the great diversity and heterogeneity of football fandom in Europe. We will investigate the selected countries with the assistance of local academic partners from the University of Valencia, University of Gdansk and the University of Oslo.

# Results
The project has produced significant and novel results that illustrate the impact of professional club football on European identity and social cohesion. These results include:
- Football as a Social Cohesion Tool: Football has shown promise as a means to enhance social cohesion in Europe by providing a platform for diverse audiences to engage in a shared leisure activity and promote cooperation among nations.
- European Public Football Sphere: The convergence of football coverage across national media spaces has led to the development of a European public football sphere. However, this sphere tends to be homogenous and exclusive, potentially leaving certain regions of Europe less represented.
- European Identity Formation: Football fandom has a notable influence on European identity formation. Fans exhibit stronger attachments to Europe and the EU, higher levels of support for European integration, and a more favorable perception of EU membership compared to non-fans.
- Inclusive Identities: Football fandom promotes inclusivity and diversity in European identities. Fans are more likely to consider countries outside of traditional European boundaries as part of Europe, emphasizing football's role in fostering unity and shared identity across the continent.

These findings highlight the positive effects of professional club football on European identity and social cohesion, emphasizing its potential as a cultural avenue to strengthen European unity in times of uncertainty and crises.

FANZinE builds on and expands the work done by the [EUFOOT-project ('The identity effect of Europeanised lifeworlds. Becoming European through Football?')](https://eufoot.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
