# Research Strategy 

## Methodology

We approach our research object by using a mixed-method research strategy consisting of three methodological steps:
- a **quantitative text analysis** of the media representation of European competitions in football related online media to assess media representations of national and European competitions in specialist media
- an **online panel survey of fans and non-fans** on Europe to measure the dimensions of communities of belonging and frames of reference as well as compare identity formations between countries and with non-fans
- **expert interviews with actors from clubs, associations and fan organisations** actively involved in fan work to identify current practice and future opportunities for actively promoting European awareness and cohesion

With this approach we combine quantitative with qualitative steps and seek to comprehensively investigate the processes of identity formation and its role for social cohesion across Europe.

## Case selection 
<img src="/images/Partnerlaender.png" align="right" width="200px"/> The research project examines four countries in Europe: Germany, Norway, Poland and Spain. This case selection ensures that the units of analysis vary along a set of potentially influential variables such as their national league's competitive context, their geographical location, cultural and historical factors and their connection to the EU. We will investigate the selected countries with the assistance of local academic partners from the University of Valencia, University of Gdansk and the University of Oslo.
