This years conference season is almost over and that is a good reason to report what we have contributed. 

The season started early in April with a participation in the ECPR Joint Sessions of Workshops in Mons. Regina participated in the Workshop The <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/PanelDetails.aspx?PanelID=7714&amp;EventID=121">Discursive Construction and Usage of 'Europe' and the EU in European and Domestic Policies</a> and contributed a paper on discourses of English football fans.  Alexander and Arne presented first results from the comparative discourse analysis at the <a href="https://www.sportandeu.com/2019-conference">Sports&amp;EU conference</a> in Malta in June, and Regina presented a paper on discoursive constructions of Europe among Manchester United fans at the<a href="http://www2.port.ac.uk/jean-monnet-centre-of-excellence-for-the-study-of-a-transnational-europe/events/citizenship-workshop-and-conference/"> 1st Biannual Conference of the ECPR Standing Group on Citizenship at the University of Portsmouth</a>.

In early autumn we were honoured to participate in the <a href="https://www.uaces.org/events/conferences/lisbon/">UACES 49th Annual Conference, Lisbon: 1-4 September 2019</a>. We contributed to the Panel "European Sport in Times of Brexit: Identity Formation, Intercultural Dialogue and Europeanisation of Governance Structures". Last but not least, we partipated in the <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/EventDetails.aspx?EventID=123">ECPR General Conference 2019</a> in Wroclaw with a paper <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=45085&amp;EventID=123">on social identifications among football fans in several European contries</a>.
