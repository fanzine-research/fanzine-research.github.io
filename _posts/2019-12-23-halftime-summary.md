<p>The three-year project has reached its half-time. On Dec 15th, we have been working for 1,5 years together. During this time, we could accomplish some remarkable tasks. </p>

<p>The first step of our analysis is almost done: The online message board analyses are in their final stage and there are two papers about this part of the project currently under review.  We are looking forward for the reviews and the remarks and of course, hope to have them published soon!</p>

<p>The second step, the online survey has been taken to field this summer. We are satisfied with the response rate and are busy with its analysis. First (and very preliminary results) were presented in early December in a seminar at the Unversity of Mannheim. We already got important and interesting feedback on our results. This will be a major task for the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>The coming year will start with our field work in the third step. We will spend the first third of the year conducting interviews with footballs fans of the eight clubs in our sample. Regina and Florian will spend some time in all of the cities. They are both looking forward to meet fans and record their experiences and ideas about their club in the context of Europe!</p>

<p>We wish all readers a calm and relaxing holiday break! </p>
