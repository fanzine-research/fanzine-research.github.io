Following a recent online panel on „Europeanisation of identities through every practices“ we launch a Call for Papers for a Special Issue that aims at discussing different and new ways of European identity formation and the question of how citizenship in the context of Europe is formed.

We invite brief paper proposals of up to 500 words before 30th Nov 2020. Please send the proposal including an abstract, relevant information on the context from which suggested contribution emanate, and contact details to all three editors. Further information on the aim of the SI is included in the [Call for Papers](/files/CfP_SpecialIssue_European-identity.pdf).
