Delighted to inform you that the [International Review for the Sociology of Sport](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/irs) accepted our paper “Cosmopolitans and Communitarians: A Typology of Football Fans between National and European Influences” for publication. It’s already accessible online [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10126902211028147).
 
Today, we also received the good news that the [European Journal for Sport and Society](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ress20/current) has accepted our paper entitled “A European Mind? Europeanisation of Football Fan Discussions in Online Message Boards.”
