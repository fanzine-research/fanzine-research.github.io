After a keynote speech at this year’s [“Beyond the Big Five”](https://news.unil.ch/document/1618324737556.D1619684419707)-conference, and a contribution to the “[Sport and EU](https://www.sportandeu.com/)”-conference in July, we will be hosting a panel on “The Europeanisation of Identities Through Everyday Practices” at the 51st UACES Annual Conference in early September.
 
The [panel](https://www.conftool.org/uaces2021/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=242) is slated for Wednesday, 8 Sep, 9:30-11:00 am, and also includes a paper from EUFOOT on the conditions, which may shape whether football fans attain a more Europeanised mind-set.
