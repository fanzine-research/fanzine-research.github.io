We are in the process of putting together a panel each for the Sport & EU conference in Lausanne (https://www.sportandeu.com) and the UACES conference in Lille (https://www.uaces.org/lille).
Instead of providing you with a framework panel text, here is the broad theme around which we want to build the panel: “European Sport Governance, Media, and Identities”  (no need to speak to all of these sub-themes).
If you want to be part of the panel for one or both of the conferences, please provide us with ALL of the following details:

Which conference(s)
Full Name
University/Institution
Postal Address
Email Address
The name of any co-authors
The Title of the Paper
Keyword(s)
Research Discipline (e.g. Political Science, Sociology, etc)
A 250-Word Abstract

Please, send your abstracts by 19 January to 
Jennifer Amann: [j.amann@uni-mainz.de](mailto:j.ammann@uni-mainz.de) AND 
Arne Niemann: [arne.niemann@uni-mainz.de](mailto:arne.niemann@uni-mainz.de)
