As part of the ["FORTHEM Winter School on Belonging and Non-Belonging in Europe"](https://www.jyu.fi/en/current/archive/2022/02/the-forthem-winter-school-on-belonging-and-non-belonging-in-europe){:target="_blank"_ rel="noopener"} 
organised by the University of Jyväskylä, the FANZinE team gave a keynote on "European Belonging on Football" and held a workshop on "Measuring People’s Feeling of Belonging to Europe". Together with the attending students and other contributors, we explored the importance of Football for a connected Europe and developed ideas to measure the elusive concepts of identity and belonging. It was a great opportunity to get in touc with students and teachers from all over Europe and the world. We thank the organisers for a very fruitful event.
