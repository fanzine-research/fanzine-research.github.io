The FANZinE project team organised a panel including a presentation of the preliminary results of their sports media analysis at the [2022 Sport&EU-Conference](https://www.sportandeu.com/2022-conference) in Lausanne. 
In addition to our own presentation, we were happy to receive contributions from Alexander Brand on the EUFoot-Project, Jacok Kornbeck on EU antitrust law in sports, 
and Borja Garcia on the reaction to the European Super League project.
