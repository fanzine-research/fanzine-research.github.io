As part of two panels organised by the FANZinE-Team at the [52nd Annual UACES Conference](https://www.uaces.org/lille) we presented the latest version of our paper "Becoming European through football media?". 
We thank the other contributors to the panels Alexander Brand, Andrea Cattaneo, Jacob Kornbeck, Dobroslaw Mankowski and Jan Zglinski.
