We are happy to have our first project paper published in the inaugural issue of the Sports Law, Policy & Diplomacy Journal. In the paper called "Researching Football, Identity and Cohesion in Europe" we explore the intertwined relationship between identity and social cohesion in the context of European football. 
The paper is available via open access at [https://doi.org/10.30925/slpdj.1.1.5](https://doi.org/10.30925/slpdj.1.1.5).
