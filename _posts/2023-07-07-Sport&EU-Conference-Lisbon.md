The FANZinE project team had the honour of organising and participating in the "EU Sport Policy Design and Implementation" panel at the [2023 Sport&EU Conference](https://www.sportandeu.com/2023-conference). 

We presented two papers this year that were a result of our research efforts: 
1. "Seeing Europe through 'Football Glasses'? Comparing fans and non-fans views of Europe"
2. "Becoming European through (football) media? A comparative analysis of German, Norwegian, Polish and Spanish media outlets"

In addition to our presentations, the panel featured contributions from other researchers, with papers on "Towards an EU sport diplomacy" by Richard Parrish, Carmen Gonzalez, and Carole Gomez, and "Year 20 AP (After Parrish): What has sport taught us about the European Union" by Borja Garcia. The conference was an excellent platform for exchanging ideas and discuss issues in European sports.
