We're thrilled to announce the publication of our latest research in the *Journal of Common Market Studies*. Our comparative quantitative text analysis investigates how football media across Germany, Norway, Poland, and Spain contributes to a European public sphere. Resulst show extensive, but selective media coverage that leaves many parts of Europe on the sidelines of the football discourse.
The full paper - "A European Public Sphere United by Football: A Comparative Quantitative Text Analysis of German, Norwegian, Polish and Spanish Football Media" - is available in open access here: [https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.13559](https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.13559).
