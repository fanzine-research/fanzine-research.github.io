We're pleased to announce the publication of our latest research in the *Journal of Contemporary European Studies*. This study shows how football fandom can influence European identities and foster a sense of unity and belonging across the continent. Our findings suggest that football fans are more inclusive in their perception of what constitutes Europe, pointing towards the important role of cultural integration through football.
